# 🛍️ Retail Store Analysis

This project was part of my internship at **Brainwave-Matrix-Solutions**, where I worked on a dataset related to retail store performance.  
The goal was to explore the data, clean it, and extract valuable business insights through analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

- `Store_ID`: Unique identifier for each store  
- `Store_Area`: Physical area of the store (in square yards)  
- `Items_Available`: Number of different items in the store  
- `Daily_Customer_Count`: Average number of monthly customers  
- `Store_Sales`: Sales in USD  
- `Store_Size`: Created column that categorizes store areas into 4 size groups

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration

- Checked for missing and duplicate values  
- Explored data distribution and feature correlations  
- Created a new feature `Store_Size` based on `Store_Area`  

---

## ❓ Step 2: Business Questions

- Which stores have the most products?  
- Which stores generate the highest sales?  
- Does store size affect customer count or product availability?

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🔸 Distribution & Concentration:
- Data is normally distributed  
- Most store areas are between **1250 - 1750 sq yards**  
- Majority of stores are **Medium Size**  
- Weak correlation among most features  

### 🔸 Item Availability:
- Increases with store area  
- **Very Large** stores have the most items  

### 🔸 Customer Count:
- Remains nearly the same across all store sizes  
- Not significantly affected by store size  

### 🔸 Sales:
- Similar across most sizes  
- Slightly higher in **Very Large** stores (due to more items available)
